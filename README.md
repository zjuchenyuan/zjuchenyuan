### Hi there 👋 ![](https://d.py3.io/blank.gif?from=github)

Disclaimer: I'm not affiliated with saturnbeam at any level. I'm just an investor who did his own research by checking the code.

What I did: Post an [issue](https://github.com/SaturnFinance/saturn-protocol/issues/1) asking a question about the wrong reward design.

Think: Will I make a rug with my own idendity? Stop accusing innocent people without proof!

声明一下 我只是投了这个saturnbeam项目之后顺手看一下代码发现人家代码逻辑有问题，就发了这个[issue](https://github.com/SaturnFinance/saturn-protocol/issues/1)提问

我和这个跑路的SaturnFinance项目没有任何关联，在发现风险后就撤出了我的投资，差点损失惨重

动点脑子想想，要是我想卷款跑路我会用实名github账号提问嘛？质疑我的拿出证据
